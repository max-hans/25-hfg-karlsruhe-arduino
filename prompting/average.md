# average jittery sensor data

## User

you are an expert python developer.
write code in MicroPython

i have a sensor attached to my pi pico, the analog read values are quite jittery. write code that filters this noise

## ChatGPT

Sure! One common technique to filter noise from sensor readings is to use a moving average filter. This filter computes the average of the last N sensor readings, where N is the size of the moving window.

Here's an example code in MicroPython for implementing a moving average filter for your sensor readings on a Raspberry Pi Pico:

```python

from machine import ADC, Timer

# Define constants
SENSOR_PIN = 26  # Assuming the sensor is connected to pin 26
MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE = 10  # Adjust this value based on your requirements

# Initialize ADC
adc = ADC(0)  # Use ADC channel 0 for analog input

# Initialize variables
sensor_values = [0] * MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE
current_index = 0
filtered_value = 0

# Function to update the moving average
def update_average(timer):
    global sensor_values, current_index, filtered_value

    # Read sensor value
    raw_value = adc.read()

    # Update moving window
    sensor_values[current_index] = raw_value
    current_index = (current_index + 1) % MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE

    # Compute filtered value
    filtered_value = sum(sensor_values) / MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE

# Initialize and start timer for updating the moving average
timer = Timer()
timer.init(period=100, mode=Timer.PERIODIC, callback=update_average)

# Main loop (can be empty if you just want to read filtered_value)
while True:
    pass

```

This code sets up an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) on the Raspberry Pi Pico, reads analog values from the sensor connected to pin 26, and then continuously updates a moving average of these values. The size of the moving window for the moving average is defined by the MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE constant. You can adjust this value based on your requirements for filtering out the noise.

Feel free to modify this code according to your specific sensor and requirements!

this code uses a lot of exotic stuff. stick to basic functions.

Sure, let's simplify it. We can achieve the same functionality without using advanced features like timers. Here's a simpler version using a basic loop:

```python

from machine import ADC
import time

# Define constants

SENSOR_PIN = 26 # Assuming the sensor is connected to pin 26
MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE = 10 # Adjust this value based on your requirements

# Initialize ADC

adc = ADC(0) # Use ADC channel 0 for analog input

# Initialize variables

sensor_values = [0] \* MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE
current_index = 0

# Function to update the moving average

def update_average():
global sensor_values, current_index

    # Read sensor value
    raw_value = adc.read()

    # Update moving window
    sensor_values[current_index] = raw_value
    current_index = (current_index + 1) % MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE

    # Compute and return filtered value
    return sum(sensor_values) / MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE

# Main loop

while True:
filtered_value = update_average()
print("Filtered Value:", filtered_value)
time.sleep(0.1) # Adjust the sleep time as needed
```

This version simplifies the code by removing the timer and directly calling the update_average function in a loop. It achieves the same functionality of continuously updating a moving average of sensor readings. Adjust the sleep time according to how often you want to sample the sensor and update the filtered value.

AttributeError: 'ADC' object has no attribute 'read'

## ChatGPT

Apologies for the confusion. Let's correct that. In MicroPython, the ADC object doesn't have a read method. Instead, you need to use the read_u16 method to read the raw analog value. Here's the corrected code:

```python

from machine import ADC
import time

# Define constants

SENSOR_PIN = 26 # Assuming the sensor is connected to pin 26
MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE = 10 # Adjust this value based on your requirements

# Initialize ADC

adc = ADC(Pin(SENSOR_PIN))

# Initialize variables

sensor_values = [0] \* MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE
current_index = 0

# Function to update the moving average

def update_average():
global sensor_values, current_index

    # Read sensor value
    raw_value = adc.read_u16()

    # Update moving window
    sensor_values[current_index] = raw_value
    current_index = (current_index + 1) % MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE

    # Compute and return filtered value
    return sum(sensor_values) / MOVING_WINDOW_SIZE

# Main loop

while True:
filtered_value = update_average()
print("Filtered Value:", filtered_value)
time.sleep(0.1) # Adjust the sleep time as needed

```

This code should now work correctly with MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
